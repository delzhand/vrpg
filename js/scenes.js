  `SCENE: The First Vision
  EXPO: Saoirse crouched near the middle of the ancient subterranean plaza, near a crumbling stone wall. A skeleton hobbled past her clumsily, dim embers in its eyes.
  EXPO: She ignored it, and surveyed the area. The skeletons weren't a <i>huge</i> threat alone, for the most part they could just be knocked over, or if you wanted a laugh, you could grab their skulls and punt them into the pools of milky cave water nearby.
  EXPO: The statues were another story. The stone sentinels patrolled these ruins, even centuries after the fall of their kingdom. Had their creators intended them to wander the dark indefinitely, or was it just an oversight?
  EXPO: Saoirse shook her head. She could ponder the mysteries of the ancients once she'd retrieved the Kingsword from the shrine at the center of the plaza. She set her lantern down and held out her palm.
  SAOIRSE-1|L: Limini, I need a distraction.
  EXPO: A pair of feline eyes opened in a nearby shadow.
  LIMINI|R: Hmph. Making me do your dirty work?
  SAOIRSE-1|L: I thought cats were naturally curious. Don't you want to see the Kingsword?
  EXPO: The eyes turned towards the shrine. There was a flicker in the shadow, the merest suggestion of a twitching tail.
  LIMINI|R: <span class="smaller">...a little bit.</span>
  EXPO: The spectral cat took on a more substantial form and bounded off towards the patrolling automaton, which mindlessly gave chase. Saoirse grinned and tightened her cloak, then sprinted for the shrine.

  `SCENE: The Second Vision
  EXPO: Saoirse stood at the top of the sand dune and looked west, over the rooftops of the fishing village. The ocean was choppy, and summer's heat had given way to more moderate weather. But the wind was high, which was exactly what she wanted. Today was the day.
  EXPO: She'd discovered the craft while mapping the woods further inland. It had been badly damaged, abandoned long ago. Long ago enough that the forest had almost claimed it entirely, much like its former rider's bones. But it called to her, begged to be restored.
  EXPO: Several other residents of the fishing village had come to the dune to watch. There was a general sense of optimism - Saoirse's previous attempts had met with halting, cautious success. But today was the real test.
  EXPO: She pulled her goggles down and knocked back the kickstand with her heel. She placed a gloved palm on the machine's nameplate. The whirring magical engine at the heart of the machine whispered to her.
  ???|L: Are you ready to fly, rider?
  SAOIRSE-2|R: Are <i>you</i>, Branford?
  BRANFORD|L: I was <i>made</i> to fly.
  EXPO: The engine flared, and the arc-halo lifted the craft off the ground. This was going to make charting the island much easier.
  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: The Third Vision
  EXPO: Saoirse swatted a tree branch out of the way and gripped her reins tightly. She was on edge - the blood panther had been spotted in this forest only a few days ago. It had killed two cows and wounded a farmer in the nearby village. But she'd pursued it this far, and she wasn't about to let a tangle of scrub and fallen logs stop her now.
  EXPO: A hart, previously still with fear, darted away somewhere to her left. Her wyvern turned to follow it, and she gently tugged on the reins to bring its focus back to <i>her</i> hunt.
  SAOIRSE-3|L: I know you're hungry, Ambrose. You can hunt once we're done.
  EXPO: She'd taken the job reluctantly. She didn't need the money at the moment, and blood panthers tended to hide during the day. But the village didn't have anyone capable of taking down a beast like this on their own. And left to their own devices, blood panthers would mate with regular panthers, always passing down their voracious appetite and wild strength to their offspring through some cruel trick of heredity.
  EXPO: Ambrose stopped and sniffed at the ground. His nostrils flared. Saoirse checked the straps on her scale mail and grabbed one of her spear from the saddle harness. Her prey was near. She clenched her teeth and dropped down from Ambrose's back. The growl from the overhang was unmistakable, and she dug in her heels as the panther dropped towards her.

  `SCENE: Prologue
  EXPO: Saoirse rolled over in her bed, away from the morning sunlight. She had slept fitfully, and her dreams, though vivid in sleep, began to fade into the clarity of consciousness. She sat up after a moment, throwing off the heavy comforter.
  PROMPT: One of these is not a dream, but a memory. Who is Saoirse?
  VOTE-CLOSED: A machine-flying cartographer%66|A dungeon-delving relic seeker%33|A wyvern-riding monster hunter
  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: Saoirse's House | Bolba Village
  EXPO: Saoirse swung her legs over the edge of the bed and looked blearily around the small thatched roof hut that she called home. Her clothes, rumpled and untidy, lay in a pile. Her cartography instruments, meticulously organized, lay on her desk, along with rolls of paper, maps in various degrees of completion. A pair of crutches stood in the corner, crutches she no longer needed.
  EXPO: It had been two months since the near-disastrous test flight.
  EXPO: Saoirse stretched and sat down in a wicker chair by the kitchen window. The fishing village was already bustling with activity - men and women setting sail in one- and two-person crafts, mending and emptying nets, or chatting with one another about this or that topic.
  EXPO: She noticed a shadow fall across the gap between the canvas flap that served as a door and the floor.
  ???|R: Saoirse! You awake?
  SAOIRSE|L: Just a minute, Parzeval!
  EXPO: She pulled a tunic and breeches off the floor and quickly pulled them on. Parzeval would no doubt be seeking company for some errand. As the village chief's son, he seemed to have endless responsibility, despite being no older than she was.
  EXPO: She pushed past the canvas flap and onto the sand strew planks of her porch. Parzeval awaited her, wearing his customary easy grin.
  PARZEVAL|R: How's the leg?
  SAOIRSE|L: I'm still being careful. Probably more careful than I need to be, honestly!
  PARZEVAL|R: And Branford?
  EXPO: Saoirse stepped towards the coverend object on the porch and pulled the tarp off. She knocked twice on the aeroframe's headlamp.
  BRANFORD|L: Good morning, rider.
  EXPO: Parzeval winced. Branford's left front wing had been torn off completely in the accident.
  SAOIRSE|L: We won't be soaring until I can figure out how to fashion new wing, but we can still skim along the surface.
  PARZEVAL|R: Good, then you can come down to the beach and help me clear a nest of ocean jellies. Father said the fishermen discovered it under the pier.
  EXPO: Saoirse groaned. Ocean jellies weren't dangerous, but they'd cling to the pier supports and calcify, emitting a horrendous odor all the while.
  PARZEVAL|R: Please? He let me borrow the Stormstaff.
  SAOIRSE|L: I can see that.
  EXPO: He wore the staff across his back, its lapis blue gem gleaming in the sun. It was a symbol of the village chief's authority and contained some small amount of magic. 
  SAOIRSE|L: Fine, fine. Let me just grab a shovel. I'll meet you by the pier.
  EXPO: Parzeval's grin broadened.
  PARZEVAL|R: Excellent. I owe you one!
  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: Pier | Bolba Village
  EXPO: It took the better part of an hour, but eventually the jellies had all been dislodged. Saoirse had used the flat of the shovel like a catapult, hurling them into deeper waters, while Parzeval had pounded them with magic from his father's staff. Presently they sat on the pier, Saoirse reclining in Branford's seat, Parzeval dangling his legs off the pier.
  PARZEVAL|L: So let me get this straight. You crashed because you tried to fly over water?
  BRANFORD|R: Correct.
  PARZEVAL|L: And you fly using magic...
  BRANFORD|R: The arc-halo is not magic. It is an elemental construct. I bond with the earth at two points, ahead and behind. The circle on the ground is simply a visual artifact of the energies expended.
  PARZEVAL|L: That sounds like magic to me.
  BRANFORD|R: You ambulate by shifting your weight over your legs, is that "magic"?
  EXPO: Parzeval pondered this.
  PARZEVAL|L: Nope, still don't get it.
  EXPO: A lonely gull squawked overhead. Saoirse watched it drift further down the beach, riding the wind, barely needing to move its wings.
  SAOIRSE|L: ...Branford, are there others like you?
  EXPO: For a moment, there was silence, except for the waves. 
  BRANFORD|R: Rider, I do not wish to discuss this topic. May we discuss another?
  PROMPT: Branford doesn't want to talk about his origins. What does Saoirse ask instead?

  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: Pier | Bolba Village
  SAOIRSE|L: What's it going to take to get you into the air again, I wonder?
  BRANFORD|R: I suppose one of your engineers could craft a replacement wing.
  PARZEVAL|L: "Engineer"?
  BRANFORD|R: The men and women who fashion your boats out of wood. Is that not the right word? What do you call them?
  PARZEVAL|L: Anyone can make a boat with practice. We don't have a special name for them.
  SAOIRSE|L: I suppose I could take the measurements of your right wing and draw something up. It's kind of like making a map...
  BRANFORD|R: That is logical, yes. Though I suspect the mismatched weight might be an issue.
  SAOIRSE|L: You're an amazing machine, Branford. I'd love to meet the person who created you originally.
  EXPO: The seconds stretched out in silence. Parzeval stood up and put his hands on his hips, staring out past the gentle waves.
  PARZEVAL|R: I suppose I've rested long enough. Father will expect me back before too long.
  EXPO: Saoirse started Branford's engine and he rose gently to idle a foot or so above the pier.
  SAOIRSE|L: I think I'll ask Garven to help with the wing.
  PARZEVAL|R: You might be waiting a while. He's deep-fishing with Yuda today. Why don't you ask your grimma?
  EXPO: Saoirse sighed.
  PARZEVAL|R: You can't avoid her forever.
  SAOIRSE|L: I can try.
  EXPO: She revved Branford's engine and shot down the pier, then took a hard turn, kicking up sand. Parzeval watched her fly down the beach, shaking his head.
  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: Hoay Cliffs | Northern Bolba
  BRANFORD|L: What is a "grimma"?
  EXPO: Saoirse was crouched by a fallen tree, holding a knotted string against it.
  SAOIRSE|R: It means your father's mother or your mother's mother.
  BRANFORD|L: I see. A "grandmother".
  SAOIRSE|R: It sounds weird when you say it like that. Gur-and muth-err.
  BRANFORD|L: And you dislike your "grimma"?
  EXPO: Saoirse frowned and stood up. She'd ridden Branford north to where the cliffs pushed up sharply, enclosing the tiny village of Bolba against the forest to the east. A recent storm had pushed over some of the trees here, and while the ones large enough to be carved into canoes had all been dragged back to the village, she hoped to find a leftover piece suitable for whittling down into a wing.
  SAOIRSE|R: I don't dislike her.
  BRANFORD|L: But you are avoiding her?
  SAOIRSE|R: <i>I do not wish to discuss this topic.</i>
  BRANFORD|L: I understand.
  EXPO: Saoirse bit her lip and walked past Branford to another log. She brushed off the sandy soil and held the measuring string against it.
  SAOIRSE|R: I think this one will work. What do you think? It won't be as shiny as your original wing, but we can paint it! Maybe blue?
  BRANFORD|L: Can you describe blue to me?
  SAOIRSE|R: Describe... blue?
  BRANFORD|L: Rider... I do not have eyes. I do not see as you do.
  EXPO: Saoirse sat down on the log and stared at Branford. This machine, this evidence of a world beyond the island... She had so many questions, and yet every time she pressed...
  SAOIRSE|R: Well, if I was going to describe a color, blue is probably the easiest. It's the color of a clear sky, the color of the ocean when the sun is high... the color of your stripe, if we can get the hue right.
  BRANFORD|L: If you find the color pleasing and it allows me to fly again, that will be enough for me.
  EXPO: Saoirse nodded.
  SAOIRSE|R: Then that's what we'll do. We'll bring Garven out here this evening and he can help me get this log back to the village.
  SAOIRSE|R: In the meantime... let's see. We could try to get rid of the mossfox that's been attacking the chickens. Or we could try to map some more of the forest.
  BRANFORD|L: I could instruct you in some ground maneuvers, if you desire.
  PROMPT: How will Saoirse spend the rest of the day?
  VOTE-CLOSED: Fight the mossfox (+XP)%57|Map the forest (+ITEM)%14|Rider training (+SKILL)%29
  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: Joban's Farm | Bolba Village
  EXPO: Saoirse eased up on the throttle as she approached the farmhouse, and the arc-halo shrank below Branford's floating chassis. Joban was tending to the raised beds, rows of neat wooden boxes filled with sprouting vegetables. He pulled a wagon behind him, heaped high with the dark, rich loam Joban mixed every spring. He stopped at one of the beds and scattered a few handfuls of the stuff.
  SAOIRSE|L: Joban! 
  EXPO: Joban was a man of middle age, broad shouldered and tan. He stood and dusted off his hands.
  JOBAN|R: Afternoon, Saoirse. Heard you and Parzeval knocked those slimes on the pier into next week!
  SAOIRSE|L: Sure did! I thought we'd swing by and see if we can help with <i>your</i> pest problem, too.
  EXPO: Joban looked past her.
  JOBAN|R: Did you leave Parzeval in the dust?
  SAOIRSE|L: Huh?
  JOBAN|R: I thought you said "we"?
  SAOIRSE|L: No, me and Branford.
  EXPO: Joban frowned, and Saoirse was reminded that not everyone viewed Branford the same way she did. There was a merchant who visited the island on a modestly sized ship about once a year to trade for the various crafts the village produced. He had a machine similar to Branford, though it didn't speak - or perhaps it only spoke to the trader, in that strange, fluttering native tongue of his. The villagers regarded even <i>that</i> with suspicion.
  EXPO: When she'd first discovered Branford in the forest, Joban had helper Saoirse get them back to the village, suggesting that he could be fitted with a plow and used to till the earth. Saoirse had argued against it, and, well... the tension had never <i>really</i> been resolved.
  EXPO: Still, though, Joban was a friendly sort, and not a holder of grudges, even if he didn't quite accept the Branford as a real member of the village.
  SAOIRSE|L: So... what's the story with the mossfox? Have you seen it recently?
  EXPO: Joban leaned on the raised bed and scratched his nose.
  JOBAN|R: Yeah, it was here... three nights afore. I set up a whole mess of strings and bell-shells around henhouse, and sure enough it got to janglin'. I ran outside and chased it off before it could snatch up another chicken. It ran off to the southeast. If you're gonna chase it down, the first place I'd look is Shalebed.
  EXPO: Shalebed was a series of flat stones that jutted out of the beach along the island's southern edge. As low tide, a small grotto could be accessed, perhaps a decent hideout for a fox to grow fat on pilfered poultry.
  SAOIRSE|L: I'll head that way then. Let's see if I can frighten that thing off for good.
  JOBAN|R: Well, don't be afraid to smack it with that shovel if you have to. It's still a wild animal, and it's got teeth as pointing as anything.
  EXPO: Saoirse nodded, and swung Branford around in a tight circle.
  SAOIRSE|L: Just you wait! We'll take care of it!
  EXPO: For the second time that day, she sped away from someone who was left quietly shaking their head.
  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: Shalebed | Southern Bolba
  BRANFORD|R: Rider, should we not have consulted the tide-charts before coming down here?
  EXPO: Saoirse clenched her teeth and she pressed a scrap of cloth to her arm. Despite Joban's warnings, she hadn't been prepared for the fox to actually jump up on Branford and begin biting her. She had flung the creature away long enough to safely lower Branford onto the wet rock of the grotto's floor, and then taken a few swings with her trusty shovel. She had missed it each time, craftly little bugger, but when she struck the stone hard enough to make the metal spade head send off a few tiny sparks, the creature decided it had had enough, and darted away down one of the cave's passages. She had let it go.
  EXPO: Her hand wasn't bleeding badly, but she could probably expect some redness and swelling. She emptied a canteen of fresh water over the wound and pulled the cloth bandage tight using her teeth. She flexed her fingers experimentally. Her leg had only just healed, she did not like the prospect of being laid up unable to ride Branford should there be any sign of infection.
  BRANFORD|R: Rider?
  SAOIRSE|L: We'll be fine. High tide shouldn't be for another few hours.
  BRANFORD|R: Perhaps, but we are not at the high tide waterline, we are far below it. And I'm detecting an increase in elemental water energy.
  EXPO: Saoirse's eyes went wide. How could she be so foolish?
  SAOIRSE|L: Damn it!
  EXPO: She jumped on Branford's seat and started his engine, but foamy water was already beginning to slosh into the cave entrance.
  BRANFORD|R: I may not be able to generate enough lift to carry us over the water at anything less than full throttle, rider.
  SAOIRSE|L: What if we crash again? I dropped you on land last time, but you told me that if your core is flooded with water...
  BRANFORD|R: I will become inert, yes. But we have little choice. If this cavern floods, the same fate awaits for certain.
  EXPO: Saoirse looked over her shoulder at the cave. The fox had gone down a passage that was large enough for Branford, barely. There was another passage that <i>seemed</i> to lead upwards. She'd never mapped this cave, but it stood to reason that there might be an exit that way.
  EXPO: There was no time to wait. She gripped Branford's handles...
  PROMPT: How will Saoirse and Branford deal with the rising tide?
  VOTE-CLOSED: One wing, full throttle, let's fly.%40|Trust to nature. Follow the fox.%60|The passage upwards is the only logical choice here.%0
  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: Shalebed | Southern Bolba
  EXPO: Saoirse flipped the tiny metal switch that activated Branford's headlamp and pointed him down the descending passageway.
  SAOIRSE|L: If that fox has been living in here, I bet it knows another way out.
  EXPO: She rode Branford forward. The opening was barely wide enough to accommodate his lone right wing. He was definitely not designed for such small spaces. However, past the initial squeeze, the cavern widened somewhat. The headlamp illuminated a long, fairly straight shaft that descended slightly, with a few stalactites as the only notable features.
  EXPO: Branford's lamp was the lone source of light after a minute of slow riding. The luminous yellow cone revealed no further landmarks, and Saoirse released the throttle. Branford decelerated to a stop.
  SAOIRSE|L: This seems like a safe place to wait out the tide. It doesn't look like anything else is living in here.
  BRANFORD|R: I detect no dangers, as well.
  EXPO: Saoirse kicked down the stand and hopped off Branford. The arc-engine's humming ceased.
  EXPO: Saoirse rummaged through the machine's panniers for a moment, muttering to herself.
  SAOIRSE|L: I can't see a damn thing.
  EXPO: She pulled the saddlebags free and dragged them in front of Branford's lamp.
  SAOIRSE|L: I've got flint and tinder, but I doubt we'll find enough kindling for a fire. I've got a lantern with a tiny bit of oil. I'm going to look around. Get a sense of what's in here. I can't believe I never thought to map this place.
  BRANFORD|R: Rider, do be careful. If anything should happen to you...
  EXPO: Saoirse nodded, despite knowing that her companion couldn't see the gesture.
  SAOIRSE|L: I'll be careful.
  NEXT`,
  
  `EXPO: The lantern's dim light reached far shorter than Branford's arc-lamp, but what it lacked in brightness, it made up for in range. While Branford's lamp illuminated a lengthy cone in front of him, it did little for anything behind or beside the rider. Saoirse raised the lamp, illuminating a circle around her, broken only by her own shadow.
  EXPO: She could see Branford's light some distance away, and made a note not to stray so far that she ever lost sight of it. Underground, it was her only compass.
  EXPO: She walked perpendicular to the path she'd taken into the cave, counting her steps. What she'd assumed was a narrow tunnel was actually a fairly wide open cavern, the few stalactites they'd passed on the way in were in fact a small number of many. Eventually she reached a wall. It was slick with cave-water, layered green and orange and white stone. She turned to confirm that she could still see Branford in the distance, then began counting steps along the wall.
  EXPO: It eventually curved away, and something blocked her line of sight to the aeroframe. She walked back until she could see it again, and held her lamp out, but couldn't see what it was that had blocked her view only a few steps back.
  SAOIRSE|L: Branford?
  EXPO: There was no response. She could see the bright yellow path of his light, but heard nothing. It occurred to her that she'd never communicated with him from anything more than a few feet away. Perhaps his hearing was more limited than hers, or perhaps he was simply unable to raise his voice? She began walking back towards him.
  NEXT`,

  `EXPO: She kept her lantern trained on the hard edge where Branford was blocked from view, and about halfway back to the spot where he was, Saoirse gasped as the obstruction caught the lantern light.
  PROMPT: What is the object in the cavern?
  VOTE-CLOSED: An ink-dark crystal containing a human figure%20|A sturdy metal door set into the cave wall%27|A mausoleum carved with strange symbols%53
  NEXT`,

  `EXPO: Saoirse stared at the structure. In the color-devouring blackness of the cave, it appeared to be a burial chamber of some sort. It seemed desperately out of place - all polished marble with a wrought iron gate, untouched by moss, rust, or even time.
  EXPO: Most strangely of all, though, was the angle. It was tilted ever so slightly, as if it had sunken into the ground on one side.
  EXPO: She lifted her lantern above her head. The top of the mausoleum was hidden, engulfed by the cave ceiling - no, not engulfed, it looked as if it had displaced the very stone.
  SAOIRSE|L: Branford?
  BRANFORD|R: I am here, rider.
  EXPO: Branford's voice was quiet at this distance. She set the lantern down near the iron gate and walked back to the aeroframe.
  SAOIRSE|L: I found something strange. Come on. I need your light.
  EXPO: She hopped onto the seat and let the engine's idle float them gently towards the mausoleum.
  SAOIRSE|L: What do you think?
  BRANFORD|R: Whatever it is, it seems incongruous with the environs.
  SAOIRSE|L: What does it look like to you?
  BRANFORD|R: I can perceive only the outside. That's strange. Usually I can identify internal structures, though not with high accuracy. Here, though... nothing.
  SAOIRSE|L: There's nothing like this anywhere else on any part of the island that I've found. These carvings don't look like our language.
  EXPO: She traced her hands over the carvings.
  SAOIRSE|L: Though skulls are a pretty universal symbol, I suppose...
  EXPO: Her gaze drifted to the gate.
  SAOIRSE|L: I want to see what's inside. Parzeval's gonna love this.
  EXPO: She grabbed the handles of the gate and pulled. It was heavy and cold to the touch, and the blood soaked bandage on her right hand prickled as she strained.
  EXPO: Suddenly, the resistance fell away and the gates swung open easily on silent hinges.
  BRANFORD|R: Rider, watch out! I'm detecting-
  EXPO: A skeletal figured burst from the open crypt and barreled into Saoirse.
  SKELETON|R: CAN MY MISTRESS FIND NO RESPITE?
  EXPO: The skeleton was taller than any man Saoirse had ever met, and carried itself with a prouder bearing than one expected of animated bones. It brandished a long, needle-like blade.
  SKELETON|R: OPENED BY BLOOD WAS THE GATE, ONLY BY SELFSAME BLOOD MAY IT BE RE-SEALED.
  EXPO: It thrust its sword at Saoirse, who threw herself backwards towards Branford and grabbed for her shovel. She tightened her grip and readied herself as the skeleton lunged.
  PROMPT: There's no escape and only one chance to gain an advantage. What will Saoirse do?
  VOTE-CLOSED: Swing low, for the legs (-SPD)%57|Swing high, for the head (-DEF)%29|Swing mid, for its weapon/arm (-ATK)%14`,

  `EXPO: Bleeding and exhausted, Saoirse dropped the shovel and watched the embers dim in the skull's eye sockets.
  SKELETON|R: PROTECT... HER...
  EXPO: The command bounced off the cave walls and faded into silence.
  SAOIRSE|L: Branford, I...
  EXPO: She swayed dizzily.
  BRANFORD|R: Steady on, rider. Don't collapse down here or we'll both be stuck.
  SAOIRSE|L: I'll be okay. I just need... a moment.
  EXPO: She slumped against the mausoleum wall, streaking it red. The skeleton's sword lie next to her. She picked it up, admiring the intricate details etched into the basket hilt. She felt her eyes growing heavy.
  BRANFORD|R: Rider?
  EXPO: There was no response.
  BRANFORD|R: Rider, I don't want to go dormant down here...
  BRANFORD|R: Rider?
  BRANFORD|R: Rider?
  BRANFORD|R: Rider?

  `EXPO: Soairse drifted in and out of consciousness.
  EXPO: She heard a voice, or maybe two, calling her name.
  EXPO: She was aware of being hauled up by gentle hands, carried over someone's shoulder. She saw Branford's headlamp growing distant, and then nothing.
  EXPO: Then, later, soft blankets and salt breeze. In the distance, arguing voices.
  EXPO: Later still, pain and bitter herbs, and the smell of medicine...

  `SCENE: Ao Monastery | Northeastern Bolba
  EXPO: Hanya's tail flicked back and forth as she sat atop the sandstone wall surrounding the monastery. She wasn't technically allowed up there, but she'd proven time and again to be the most agile of Master Ilyon's disciples, the the chances of her getting caught we almost nil. 
  EXPO: She watched the younger monks practicing their basic forms in the courtyard. Brother Fang walked among them, straightening shoulders, bending arms, adjusting footing. He knocked his staff against the shin of one student who kept falling out of time with the others.
  EXPO: Hanya had felt that staff many times. Brother Fang was sparse with praise and quick with discipline, but this was nothing compared to how Master Ilyon trained the older students.
  EXPO: Hanya's ear twitched and she instinctively flattened down, out of sight. Someone had said her name, though the YAH!s and HA!s from the courtyard obliterated the context. She caught another voice.
  ???|L: ...Hanya. She's the...
  ???|R: ...Bolba in two...
  EXPO: Hanya hopped down on the exterior side of the wall and tried to look nonchalant as she re-entered the monastery via the heavy, studded iron gates. Master Ilyon and Brother Bagan stood just inside. Ilyon was slender with muscles like iron cord and his once luxurious mane was now thinning and gray. Bagan was as different as was possible - heavyset, closely cropped black hair, full hume with no Felid traits. 
  EXPO: Bagan had a piece of paper in his hand. Hanya bowed respectfully to her master, and nodded to Bagan.
  HANYA|L: Adana, Master. Adana, Brother Bagan.
  BAGAN|R: Adana, Sister Hanya.
  ILYON|R: Hanya. Stay off the monastery walls. You set a bad example for the youths.
  HANYA|L: Was it that obvious?
  EXPO: Ilyon reached out an picked a tiny chip of sandstone off sandstone, and flicked it away.
  ILYON|R: To me, it is. However, in place of punishment, I have an important task for you. You can thank Bagan later, it was he who recommended you for the task.
  ILYON|R: You will go to Bolba village, on the far side of the island. One of the villagers, a young woman, has been wounded badly, and they have requested our healing arts.
  EXPO: Hanya looked at Bagan. Any chance to get out of the monastery was not to be turned down, especially if it meant avoiding punishment, but a task like this was hardly her specialty.
  HANYA|L: Why me? My mantra is... not the strongest. 
  BAGAN|R: It will be enough. The injured villager's strength is failing fast. Better to have a competent healer in two days than a strong one in four.
  EXPO: Master Ilyon nodded in agreement.
  ILYON|R: That which is not tested grows no stronger. Your mantra cannot be practiced on the already healthy.
  ILYON|R: There is one thing I would like you to have before you go. Bagan?
  EXPO: Bagan pulled a capped ceramic cylinder from his robe and held it forward with both hands. Hanya recognized it instantly. She turned to Ilyon.
  HANYA|L: Master...?
  ILYON|R: You are ready for this technique. Study it well as you travel, and demonstrate your mastery of it when you return.
  PROMPT: What secret technique does Master Ilyon offer Hanya?

  `SCENE: Juun Mountain Path | Eastern Bolba
  EXPO: Hanya moved quickly down the mountain path that lead to the monastery. It was fully autumn now, and the fallen leaves had covered the road in a crunchy layer of brown-gold. Fall rain would soon come, and the leaves would soon flatten, break down, and become slick, rendering the path impassable to all but the monks.
  EXPO: Not that the monastery received any visitors. Bolba village was the only other settlement on the island, and when they needed assistance they always sent a messenger gull.
  EXPO: Hanya re-read the letter. The villager was a girl, barely an adult, stabbed, though by who had not been mentioned. This concerned her. The monks were often called to administer justice if a crime had been committed that the villagers could't handle on their own, but she didn't want to become involved in their affairs. It was a hume village, and Master Ilyon said there was still some distrust of Felids there.
  EXPO: She just wanted to make it to the village, heal the girl, practice the new technique she'd learned, and perhaps watch the men work on the beach, with their rippling muscles, sweat glistening on their bodies, clothes wet and clinging...
  EXPO: Hanya shook her head. Maybe if the girl could be helped there would be time for indulgences later. It wouldn't reflect well on the monastery if she showed up, bedded a handsome young man, and then failed to achieve anything with her mantra.

  `SCENE: Inland Forest | Central Bolba
  HANYA|L: You there!
  EXPO: A man in a ragged robe on the path ahead of her turned around as she approached. He was dark of skin, his grey hair dangling heavily in dreadlocks over his shoulders. She couldn't tell if the robe concealed a tail, but she didn't see tufted ears.
  ???|R: Didn't think I'd see an Ao monk so far down the mountain.
  HANYA|L: I didn't expect to encounter the island hermit. Isn't your home a ways north of here, uh...
  AZAKIR|R: Azakir. And yes, it is. But I'm going to the village. There's some work I gotta do there.
  HANYA|L: Do you need an escort? I'm afraid I'm in a hurry.
  EXPO: The man drew the blade she hadn't even seen in a flash, cutting cleanly through a falling seedpod. Hanya watched the two halves fall onto the ground.
  AZAKIR|R: These bones, they're old, but they ain't feeble. I'll make it there in my own time, but I gotta say, I'd turn back if I were you.
  EXPO: Hanya studied him carefully. He was old, but not as old as Master Ilyon. His robe was a style apart from what they wore in the village, and it was threadbare around the elbows and sleeves. Everyone knew of the island hermit, but he caught his own fish and tended his own crops, and that made him a rarely seen figure.
  HANYA|L: Turn back? Why? There's a girl who needs my help.
  EXPO: He sheathed his single-edged blade with single smooth motion.
  AZAKIR|R: Shouldn't talk of it. It's bad luck, s'pose. Could be nothin'. Go on ahead, help your girl. If I'm wrong, maybe we'll see each other there.
  EXPO: Hanya nodded.
  HANYA|L: Well, Azakir, I hope everything works out alright and I see you in the village. Stay safe!
  EXPO: She gave a small wave and walked on a bit before breaking out into a jog again.
  PROMPT: What obstacle lies between the forest and the village?

  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: Makrus Gorge | Central Bolba
  EXPO: Hanya blew out her breath and kicked a rock over the edge. It took several seconds for it to reach the river below. Hanya scowled.
  EXPO: The Makrus Gorge cut the island more or less in half. She'd made such good time so far, only to discover that the summer storms had taken their toll on an over-long oak branch, which had dropped directly on the only bridge for miles. The abundant part of the bridge itself dangled off the far side, still attached to the far supports, but the broken planks at the end twisting in the wind. The smaller part was on her side, mere ropes left.
  EXPO: Hanya paced back and forth, considering her options.
  EXPO: It was too far to leap across, obviously. She didn't have the expertise or tools to repair the bridge. The rapids far below were too dangerous to cross even if she scaled down the side of the gorge, an already dangerous feat. Following the gorge to the shore and crossing there would add days to her journey - days that the wounded girl likely didn't have.
  EXPO: If there was a solution here, she wasn't seeing it. She sat down, cross-legged, and closed her eyes.
  BREAK
  EXPO: Despite her training, she'd always found meditation difficult. Stillness was not a virtue she possessed. She considered the environment. The gorge was a break in the forest treetops, exposing a cloudy gray sky. The air was cool but damp with the mist from the raging waters below. The smell of mossy tree trunks, bark, pitch, mud...
  ???|L: Adana!
  EXPO: Her eyes snapped open at the greeting. The old man couldn't have caught up already, she thought. But sure enough, he ambled easily down the path.
  HANYA|R: You know the Ao greeting?
  AZAKIR|L: Learned it years ago, I reckon. I just didn't want to catch you off guard. Odd spot to meditate in, gotta say.
  HANYA|R: The bridge is out.
  EXPO: He closed the gap between them and looked at the frayed ropes trailing from the near supports. He pushed on the supports to see if they were stable, peered down into the gorge, and then looked up towards the remainder of the broken branch. He grunted.
  HANYA|R: Any ideas?
  EXPO: Azakir set down his pack and rummaged through it. He pulled out a long coil of rope with a metal hook at one end.
  AZAKIR|L: How's your throwing arm?
  HANYA|R: You... just happened to have a grapnel?
  AZAKIR|L: S'called experience. Comes with bein' old. I highly recommend it.
  HANYA|R: Experience, or being old?
  AZAKIR|L: You figure out how to get the former without the latter comin' along, you let me know.
  EXPO: He handed her the hook.
  AZAKIR|L: Can you walk a tightrope, or do you want to go hand over hand?
  HANYA|R: You can see my tail, right?
  AZAKIR|L: Didn't want to assume. Once you're on the other side, you throw this back, and we can hoist the bridge back up. It won't be perfect but it'll do for now.
  BREAK
  EXPO: True to her word and species, Hanya easily crossed the gorge on the rope. The next half hour she spent tying knots at Azakir's instruction, and before long, they managed to thread the rope around the eastern supports and back and forth through the remaining slats.
  EXPO: Azakir tested his work cautiously before stepping across the hole in the bridge. If he had any fear of heights, he didn't show it, but he did hurry across with grim determination on his face.
  AZAKIR|L: Looks like we're travel partners after all.
  HANYA|R: Seems like it. Never thought I'd be walking with the island hermit.
  AZAKIR|L: I don't mind a little company now and then. It's a lonely life, being a goddessbane...
  EXPO: Hanya's jaw dropped.
  PROMPT: How does Hanya respond?
  VOTE-CLOSED: I thought the goddesses were all dead?%50|But the goddesses are the source of all life!%25|I wish I had the skill to be a goddessbane...%25
  NEXT`,

  `HANYA|L: Goddessbane...? Aren't the goddesses all dead?
  EXPO: Azakir scratched his cheek with a fingernail idly as they walked through the woods together.
  AZAKIR|R: That's the trouble with the divine, I s'pose. They don't stay dead.
  HANYA|L: Huh. I guess I don't know much about them.
  AZAKIR|R: Doesn't surprise me. The last Goddess War was well before your time.
  HANYA|L: The "Goddess War"?
  AZAKIR|R: Yeah. Let's see, where to begin... How about you tell me what you know? I'll fill in the gaps.
  EXPO: Hanya stepped over an exposed tree root and continued walking.
  HANYA|L: The goddesses came from another realm and grant the wishes of their worshippers, right? But they're not around anymore.
  EXPO: Azakir stopped.
  AZAKIR|R: Is that what they taught you at the monastery?
  HANYA|L: I wouldn't say taught. That's just what I've heard from the other monks.
  AZAKIR|R: As for where they came from, I can't rightly say. But they sure don't grant their worshippers wishes. They grant the wishes of their captors, and their strength is based on the worshippers' zeal.
  HANYA|L: Captors?
  AZAKIR|R: The goddesses are bound to relics. Every now and then someone finds one, and it always seems to wind up in the hands of a chieftain or king.
  AZAKIR|R: Dunno if it's magic or just something 'bout how people are. But it's always the kinda person who wants to control others. And goddesses ain't too picky.
  HANYA|L: Could they refuse?
  EXPO: Azakir shrugged.
  AZAKIR|R: What always ends up happening is that someone who's got a goddess on their side grows their nation, their tribe, their whatever. My people try to put a stop to things before they run into someone else who's doing the same thing.
  HANYA|L: That's a Goddess War, then.
  AZAKIR|R: Ayup. My ancestors figured out how to kill a goddess way back when, started training what people call goddessbanes. Hard on a person, though. Usually only one or two people a generation ever figure it out. Yer lookin' at one.
  HANYA|L: Wow. I had no idea. Are there others alive today?
  EXPO: Azakir laughed.
  AZAKIR|R: I hope so! I ain't gonna be kickin' around too much longer. You don't go back home once you leave the homeland though. But, uh, sometimes there ain't enough of us.
  HANYA|L: Wait, the Three Nation War on the mainland, was that...?
  EXPO: Azakir let out a heavy breath and scratched his face again.
  AZAKIR|R: Yeah. It was real bad business. Three goddesses living at once on the same landmass. Only two banes. Just me, an... well...
  EXPO: He seemed lost in thought.
  AZAKIR|R: Sorry, still some painful memories there. But hey, like you said, there ain't none floating around right now.
  HANYA|L: And if there were, they're sure not on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere!
  EXPO: Azakir let the conversation fall into silence as they continued along the path.
  BREAK
  EXPO: Eventually the faint sound of the ocean reached their ears. They were getting close to the village, but the sky had faded from the orange and red sky of sunset to the purple-blue gradient of dusk, and night would quickly chase even that faint light away. Hanya helped Azakir gather wood for a fire, and when it was set she climbed the pine overhead and settled in to take her own ease, reflecting on their earlier conversation. It wasn't terribly important, she supposed. She ought to have been focusing on her healing mantra, but there was something she had meant to ask Azakir...
  PROMPT: What was the question?
  VOTE-CLOSED: What are the goddesses like?%50|How do you actually kill a goddess?%50|How many goddesses are there?%0
  NEXT`,

  `EXPO: Hanya descended from the tree the next morning, stretched her arms and legs, and looked around. Azakir was nowhere to be seen. Had he awoken early and gone to the village alone? She was a light sleeper, it was hard to imagine he was so quiet that his departure escaped her notice. And yet, the campfire was cold, and he was nowhere to be seen.
  EXPO: She waited for a few minutes for any sound of his approach, in case he'd simply taken a morning walk, but when she heard nothing other than the morning birds' songs and the scuttle of forest critters, she gathered her pack and set her heels to the path.
  BREAK
  SCENE: Outskirts | Bolba Village
  EXPO: The forest path eventually yielded to a packed-earth road that led into the center of the village. She stopped at one of the outermost huts, where a middle-aged man was hanging laundry out to dry.
  HANYA|L: Adana, besman!
  EXPO: Besman was the greeting for non-monks. She didn't know if this man would know that, but he looked past the damp tunics and trousers, saw her temple garb, and waved back.
  MAN|R: The hermit and a monk in the same morning. What a strange day!
  EXPO: So he <i>had</i> departed for the village ahead of her. She wondered why, but her main concern now was the girl.
  HANYA|L: The Ao have sent me to do what I can for a wounded girl. Do you know where I might find her?
  MAN|R: That would be Saoirse. You'll want to follow this road down to the village square. Ask anyone down that way, they'll get you the rest of the way there.
  EXPO: Hanya nodded, waved, and continued on the road.
  BREAK
  SCENE: Town Square | Bolba Village
  EXPO: She arrived to find the town square in commotion. A crowd had gathered, although she couldn't see why. She tapped one of the bystanders on the shoulder. Hopefully she could avoid becoming involved in whatever was happening her, though a nagging voice in her head told her that was unlikely.
  HANYA|L: Adana, besman. Can you tell me where to find a girl named Saoirse?
  EXPO: The woman, wizened by years in the sun, pointed to the center of the crowd. Hanya tried to smile as she offered her thanks, hoping it was convincing.
  EXPO: She pushed her way through the crowd. At the center, Azakir and an old woman were arguing with a red-haired young woman in a blue tunic. An even younger girl, perhaps not even ten years old, with similar hair and features, stood behind the other girl. Sisters, then? She had her arms wrapped around the girl in blue's leg.
  OLD WOMAN|R: Saoirse, you must let Azakir take the girl. It is for the good of the village.
  SAOIRSE|L: I won't, grimma! She's scared of him, look!
  EXPO: True enough, the girl was hiding her face. She looked different, somehow, than the rest of the villagers, though Hanya couldn't put her finger on why.
  AZAKIR|R: Don't be difficult, girl. The child belongs with me.
  EXPO: His voice was different. Gone was the affectation of a solitary mountain man's lazy speech. He held himself straighter, just as when she'd seen him demonstrate his sword skill.
  HANYA|L: Azakir?
  AZAKIR|R: Hanya - say nothing. Leave this to me.
  SAOIRSE|L: I won't turn her over to a stranger! She needs a home with other people, not to be whisked away to live on a mountain with a creepy old man!
  EXPO: <i>Whisked away to live on a mountain?</i>
  EXPO: A young man in red stepped past the edge of the crowd, followed by his senior. Hanya recognized the elder's staff - so this was the chieftain and his son.
  SAOIRSE|L: Parzeval! The hermit is trying to take Isla!
  EXPO: The boy raised his hands, quieting the crowd.
  CHIEFTAIN|R: This is not a matter to be decided here and now. We will go to the town hall after lunch. Everyone else, back to your duties.
  EXPO: The crowd lingered. There was some movement, but somehow no one actually left. The red clad boy took the staff from his father and waved it overhead.
  PARZEVAL|L: Go home before I bring the rainclouds down on your heads! Don't you have work to do?
  EXPO: There were murmurs and grumbles as the crowd began to disperse. Hanya watched the people leave until only she and the small party involved in the argument remained.
  EXPO: The chieftain calmly took the staff back from Parzeval, and patted him on the back. He approached Hanya. She cursed her luck internally, outwardly trying to maintain a placid expression.
  CHIEFTAIN|R: Adana, Ao. As you can see, things have changed somewhat since we wrote the monastery. Perhaps you will still come with us and hear the story?
  EXPO: <i>Absolutely not</i>, she thought to herself, which were not the words she said out loud.
  HANYA: Adana, besman-do. Of course.
  CHIEFTAIN|R: Par, take Saoirse and Isla, get something to eat and meet us in the hall in an hour. Akazir, Ciara, sister Ao, please come with me.
  EXPO: Hanya looked at the older of the red haired girls, and caught her pleading eyes. A short distance away, Azakir and the old woman stood, hard eyed and stoop-shouldered respectively, but unified in purpose. The younger girl... she couldn't possibly be a goddess, right? She was the furthest thing from a goddess Hanya could have imagined.
  PROMPT: Change POV?

  `SCENE: Elder's House | Bolba Village
  EXPO: Hanya sat at the Elder's table, flanked by Azakir and the old woman the elder had called Ciara.
  AZAKIR|L: Glevarn, is it wise to leave the child in her care?
  EXPO: The elder put a teapot on the stove and fed a log into the firebox.
  GLEVARN|R: Saoirse will be fine. She's not going anywhere.
  AZAKIR|L: My concern is for the village at large.
  EXPO: Hanya leaned forward.
  HANYA|R: I'm sorry, I'm lost. Azakir, what's going on with that girl? Isn't she the one that was injured?
  GLEVARN|R: The fault is mine. I have not even asked your name.
  HANYA|R: Hanya, disciple of Ilyon.
  GLEVARN|R: Well, Hanya, it seems that Bolba is now host to a recently reborn goddess.
  CIARA|L: And it has imprinted on my granddaughter, Saoirse.
  GLEVARN|R: She seems to attract the strange. Months ago she discovered a flying machine from the mainland that had crashed here. She fixed it up and has been riding it around the village.
  GLEVARN|R: A few days ago, she rode it into a cave down by the beach. She was missing for hours before we figured out where she'd gone. When my son Parzeval found her, she'd been severely wounded. Stabbed, somehow, by the sword she now carries everywhere. Par brought her back to the village, and that's when we sent the letter to Ao.
  CIARA|L: I went to the cave the next day. Saorise was mumbling about Branford, the aeroframe. It's a kingdom machine - which is to say it's got a personality, and she didn't want it left down in the dark. She was restless and agitated, and I thought if I could bring Branford back to the surface she'd focus on getting better.
  CIARA|L: When I eventually got it back to the village, there was a girl I'd never seen before in Saoirse's house. She looked like Saoirse, but younger. Saoirse's fever had broken, and her wounds no longer pained her.
  HANYA|R: A goddess...
  AZAKIR|L: One of limited power, it seems. Which means that my job should be much easier. But Saoirse is entranced, and she wants to protect her. That's how they work.
  EXPO: Hanya considered the implications. The goddess had the appearance and behavior of a young girl. It turned her stomach to imagine her head on the chopping block.
  HANYA|R: You want to take her into the woods and execute her there?
  AZAKIR|L: Not only that. I have to destroy her relic. I believe it's the sword Saoirse carries.
  CIARA|R: You don't know my granddaughter. She's stubborn to a fault, and she doesn't trust you. She'll never hand either over willingly.
  AZAKIR|L: I don't need anyone's help. I'm only here to declare my intent. I would prefer to do this peacefully, but leaving a goddess in the care of the village is not something I will abide.
  CIARA|R: Watch yourself, Azakir. That sounded very close to a threat. If you harm Saorise, you'll never see a friendly face in this village again.
  HANYA|R: Will a goddess still gain strength without worshippers? Does she still know she's a goddess?
  AZAKIR|L: I told Saoirse that the child could live a normal life away from others, that's why I told you not to say anything, Hanya. She may not know the truth about herself now, but the goddess will eventually find out what she is.
  EXPO: Hanya felt very put out. It was clear that her presence wasn't necessary here, but Azakir's plan didn't sit right with her. But the danger a goddess posed couldn't be ignored. What would Master Ilyon do?
  PROMPT: What does Hanya decide to do?
  VOTE-OPEN: Convince Saoirse to part with Isla|Tell Saoirse the truth, let her make her own decision|Help Saoirse keep Isla from Azakir|Take neither side`
