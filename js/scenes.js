  `SCENE: The First Vision
  EXPO: Saoirse crouched near the middle of the ancient subterranean plaza, near a crumbling stone wall. A skeleton hobbled past her clumsily, dim embers in its eyes.
  EXPO: She ignored it, and surveyed the area. The skeletons weren't a <i>huge</i> threat alone, for the most part they could just be knocked over, or if you wanted a laugh, you could grab their skulls and punt them into the pools of milky cave water nearby.
  EXPO: The statues were another story. The stone sentinels patrolled these ruins, even centuries after the fall of their kingdom. Had their creators intended them to wander the dark indefinitely, or was it just an oversight?
  EXPO: Saoirse shook her head. She could ponder the mysteries of the ancients once she'd retrieved the Kingsword from the shrine at the center of the plaza. She set her lantern down and held out her palm.
  SAOIRSE-1|L: Limini, I need a distraction.
  EXPO: A pair of feline eyes opened in a nearby shadow.
  LIMINI|R: Hmph. Making me do your dirty work?
  SAOIRSE-1|L: I thought cats were naturally curious. Don't you want to see the Kingsword?
  EXPO: The eyes turned towards the shrine. There was a flicker in the shadow, the merest suggestion of a twitching tail.
  LIMINI|R: <span class="smaller">...a little bit.</span>
  EXPO: The spectral cat took on a more substantial form and bounded off towards the patrolling automaton, which mindlessly gave chase. Saoirse grinned and tightened her cloak, then sprinted for the shrine.

  `SCENE: The Second Vision
  EXPO: Saoirse stood at the top of the sand dune and looked east, over the rooftops of the fishing village. The ocean was choppy, and summer's heat had given way to more moderate weather. But the wind was high, which was exactly what she wanted. Today was the day.
  EXPO: She'd discovered the craft while mapping the woods further inland. It had been badly damaged, abandoned long ago. Long ago enough that the forest had almost claimed it entirely, much like its former rider's bones. But it called to her, begged to be restored.
  EXPO: Several other residents of the fishing village had come to the dune to watch. There was a general sense of optimism - Saoirse's previous attempts had met with halting, cautious success. But today was the real test.
  EXPO: She pulled her goggles down and knocked back the kickstand with her heel. She placed a gloved palm on the machine's nameplate. The whirring magical engine at the heart of the machine whispered to her.
  ???|L: Are you ready to fly, rider?
  SAOIRSE-2|R: Are <i>you</i>, Branford?
  BRANFORD|L: I was <i>made</i> to fly.
  EXPO: The engine flared, and the arc-halo lifted the craft off the ground. This was going to make charting the island much easier.

  `SCENE: The Third Vision
  EXPO: Saoirse swatted a tree branch out of the way and gripped her reins tightly. She was on edge - the blood panther had been spotted in this forest only a few days ago. It had killed two cows and wounded a farmer in the nearby village. But she'd pursued it this far, and she wasn't about to let a tangle of scrub and fallen logs stop her now.
  EXPO: A hart, previously still with fear, darted away somewhere to her left. Her wyvern turned to follow it, and she gently tugged on the reins to bring its focus back to <i>her</i> hunt.
  SAOIRSE-3|L: I know you're hungry, Ambrose. You can hunt once we're done.
  EXPO: She'd taken the job reluctantly. She didn't need the money at the moment, and blood panthers tended to hide during the day. But the village didn't have anyone capable of taking down a beast like this on their own. And left to their own devices, blood panthers would mate with regular panthers, always passing down their voracious appetite and wild strength to their offspring through some cruel trick of heredity.
  EXPO: Ambrose stopped and sniffed at the ground. His nostrils flared. Saoirse checked the straps on her scale mail and grabbed one of her spear from the saddle harness. Her prey was near. She clenched her teeth and dropped down from Ambrose's back. The growl from the overhang was unmistakable, and she dug in her heels as the panther dropped towards her.

  `SCENE: Prologue
  EXPO: Saoirse rolled over in her bed, away from the morning sunlight. She had slept fitfully, and her dreams, though vivid in sleep, began to fade into the clarity of consciousness. She sat up after a moment, throwing off the heavy comforter.
  PROMPT: One of these is not a dream, but a memory. Who is Saoirse?
  VOTE-CLOSED: A machine-flying cartographer%66|A dungeon-delving relic seeker%33|A wyvern-riding monster hunter
  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: Saoirse's House | Bolba Village
  EXPO: Saoirse swung her legs over the edge of the bed and looked blearily around the small thatched roof hut that she called home. Her clothes, rumpled and untidy, lay in a pile. Her cartography instruments, meticulously organized, lay on her desk, along with rolls of paper, maps in various degrees of completion. A pair of crutches stood in the corner, crutches she no longer needed.
  EXPO: It had been two months since the near-disastrous test flight.
  EXPO: Saoirse stretched and sat down in a wicker chair by the kitchen window. The fishing village was already bustling with activity - men and women setting sail in one- and two-person crafts, mending and emptying nets, or chatting with one another about this or that topic.
  EXPO: She noticed a shadow fall across the gap between the canvas flap that served as a door and the floor.
  ???|R: Saoirse! You awake?
  SAOIRSE|L: Just a minute, Parzeval!
  EXPO: She pulled a tunic and breeches off the floor and quickly pulled them on. Parzeval would no doubt be seeking company for some errand. As the village chief's son, he seemed to have endless responsibility, despite being no older than she was.
  EXPO: She pushed past the canvas flap and onto the sand strew planks of her porch. Parzeval awaited her, wearing his customary easy grin.
  PARZEVAL|R: How's the leg?
  SAOIRSE|L: I'm still being careful. Probably more careful than I need to be, honestly!
  PARZEVAL|R: And Branford?
  EXPO: Saoirse stepped towards the coverend object on the porch and pulled the tarp off. She knocked twice on the aeroframe's headlamp.
  BRANFORD|L: Good morning, rider.
  EXPO: Parzeval winced. Branford's left front wing had been torn off completely in the accident.
  SAOIRSE|L: We won't be soaring until I can figure out how to fashion new wing, but we can still skim along the surface.
  PARZEVAL|R: Good, then you can come down to the beach and help me clear a nest of ocean jellies. Father said the fishermen discovered it under the pier.
  EXPO: Saoirse groaned. Ocean jellies weren't dangerous, but they'd cling to the pier supports and calcify, emitting a horrendous odor all the while.
  PARZEVAL|R: Please? He let me borrow the Stormstaff.
  SAOIRSE|L: I can see that.
  EXPO: He wore the staff across his back, its lapis blue gem gleaming in the sun. It was a symbol of the village chief's authority and contained some small amount of magic. 
  SAOIRSE|L: Fine, fine. Let me just grab a shovel. I'll meet you by the pier.
  EXPO: Parzeval's grin broadened.
  PARZEVAL|R: Excellent. I owe you one!
  NEXT`,

  `SCENE: Pier | Bolba Village
  EXPO: It took the better part of an hour, but eventually the jellies had all been dislodged. Saoirse had used the flat of the shovel like a catapult, hurling them into deeper waters, while Parzeval had pounded them with magic from his father's staff. Presently they sat on the pier, Saoirse reclining in Branford's seat, Parzeval dangling his legs off the pier.
  PARZEVAL|L: So let me get this straight. You crashed because you tried to fly over water?
  BRANFORD|R: Correct.
  PARZEVAL|L: And you fly using magic...
  BRANFORD|R: The arc-halo is not magic. It is an elemental construct. I bond with the earth at two points, ahead and behind. The circle on the ground is simply a visual artifact of the energies expended.
  PARZEVAL|L: That sounds like magic to me.
  BRANFORD|R: You ambulate by shifting your weight over your legs, is that "magic"?
  EXPO: Parzeval pondered this.
  PARZEVAL|L: Nope, still don't get it.
  EXPO: A lonely gull squawked overhead. Saoirse watched it drift further down the beach, riding the wind, barely needing to move its wings.
  SAOIRSE|L: ...Branford, are there others like you?
  EXPO: For a moment, there was silence, except for the waves. 
  BRANFORD|R: Rider, I do not wish to discuss this topic. May we discuss another?
  PROMPT: Branford doesn't want to talk about his origins. What does Saoirse ask instead?
  VOTE-CLOSED: "Why do you call me 'rider'? I have a name."%25|"So, about your last rider..."|"How far is this island from your home?"%25|"How can I repair you?"%50`
