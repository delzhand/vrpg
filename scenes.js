  `SCENE: Southeast Granvista - Yuvalt Monastery
  MUSIC: Final Fantasy Tactics OST - Under the Stars|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcwkD_e4MVk
  EXPO: Guarding the monastery was tedious at the best of times. Today the skies were completely clouded over, and despite the lack of sunlight, the heat was oppressive. Saoirse looked down into the courtyard. One of the monks, a young woman, was moving through the steps of some form or another, probably something obtuse like "Seven Sisters Run Down the Mountain".
  EXPO: The floor hatch to the belltower lifted, and Parzeval, smartly dressed in his cadet's tunic, poked his head up from below.
  SAOIRSE|R: What's going on?
  PARZEVAL|L: Garven wants to see us in the barrack.
  SAOIRSE|R: Fine. Did he say what for?
  PARZEVAL|L: He did not.
  ACTION: Soairse jerked her thumb towards the courtyard.
  SAOIRSE|R: Does he want <i>her</i> involved?
  PARZEVAL|L: I think so.
  ACTION: Saoirse scowled.
  ???|R: Hey, where are you from?!

  `SCENE: Scene 1
  SCENE: Southeast Granvista - Oxcorn Plains
  MUSIC: Final Fantasy III - Eternal Wind|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VRWlmXuv8E
  EXPO: Saoirse wiped the sweat from her brow. Patrolling the main road through the Oxcorn Plains wasn't difficult work by any means, but today the sun beat down relentlessly. It didn't bother Parzival of course, his ice magic was enough to keep him cool with little effort. Hanya wore only a light tunic befitting the monks of her order. Garven, in his chainmail, seemed on the verge of passing out. Saoirse empathized.
  EXPO: The golden grass of the plain was stirred gently by some breeze she couldn't feel. It rippled across the miles of open land. Nary a cart was visible in either direction. Soairse put up a hand to block the sun. All it accomplished was that her hand began to feel as warm as her brow.
  GARVEN|L: I need a rest. Parzeval, can you conjure up some cold water?
  PARZEVAL|R: Fine, but this is not what I trained for.
  GARVEN|L: I'm aware. You mention it every time I ask.
  HANYA|L: Why <i>did</i> you train in-
  EXPO: Saoirse caught Hanya's attention, shaking her head just subtly enough to avoid Parzeval's attention, but it was too late.
  PARZEVAL|R: Water is the strongest of the elements! The most readily channeled! I expected that after my training I'd be placed on the front lines, where I could smite the foes of the kingdom and bring glory to my family name!
  GARVEN|L: Yet here you are, making your captain a refreshing drink.
  SAOIRSE|R: And, when you're lucky, using your gift to ensure that no passengers are molested by cursed skeletons or aggressive slimes!
  EXPO: Parzeval scowled. He liked Saoirse well enough, but could never tell if she was being enthusiastic or patronizing.
  HANYA|L: Speaking of which...
  EXPO: A human skull emerged from the grass and bobbed gently towards them. Hanya swatted it away with an open palm. It clattered to the ground.
  HANYA|L: Wait for it...
  EXPO: The company of guards looked on expectantly. Nothing happened.
  GARVEN|L: Must be a weak one.
  EXPO: Garven hefted his halberd, and as he did so, red light flared in the previously empty eye sockets. The skull darted quickly into the air out of Garven's reach and oriented itself facing the group. The remainder of a skeleton materialized, corkscrewing out from the brainpan as if its component matter had been stashed inside.
  SAOIRSE|R: And as sure as the sunrise, here comes the slime.
  EXPO: The skeleton bent over and disgorged a wet hunk of viscous semi-solid material. Whatever weird symbiotic relationship there was between slimes and cursed skeletons was a matter for scholars. The guard company tasked with keeping the road safe had a responsibility to get rid of both, wherever they appeared.

  `SCENE: Scene 2
  SCENE: Southeast Granvista - Oxcorn Plains
  MUSIC: Final Fantasy III - Eternal Wind|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VRWlmXuv8E
  EXPO: Bits of bone lay strew across the path, intermingled with globs of (thankfully) inanimate slime. Something glittered in the sunlight, catching Saoirse's eye.
  SAOIRSE|L: Hey, what's this?
  EXPO: She bent down to pick it up.
  VOTE-OPEN: A jeweled pendant|An ornate key|A pin bearing the royal crest`,

  `SCENE: Prologue
  EXPO: Saoirse crouched near the middle of the ancient subterranean plaza, near a crumbling stone wall. A skeleton hobbled past her clumsily, dim embers in its eyes.
  EXPO: She ignored it, and surveyed the area. The skeletons weren't a <i>huge</i> threat alone, for the most part they could just be knocked over, or if you wanted a laugh, you could grab their skulls and punt them into the pools of milky cave water nearby.
  EXPO: The statues were another story. The stone sentinels patrolled these ruins, even centuries after the fall of their kingdom. Had their creators intended them to wander the dark indefinitely, or was it just an oversight?
  EXPO: Saoirse shook her head. She could ponder the mysteries of the ancients once she'd retrieved the Kingsword from the shrine at the center of the plaza. She set her lantern down and held out her palm.
  SAOIRSE|L: Limini, I need a distraction.
  EXPO: A pair of feline eyes opened in a nearby shadow.
  LIMINI|R: Hmph. Making me do your dirty work?
  SAOIRSE|L: I thought cats were naturally curious. Don't you want to see the Kingsword?
  EXPO: The eyes turned towards the shrine. There was a flicker in the shadow, the merest suggestion of a twitching tail.
  LIMINI|R: <span class="smaller">...a little bit.</span>
  EXPO: The spectral cat took on a more substantial form and bounded off towards the patrolling automaton, which mindlessly gave chase. Saoirse grinned and tightened her cloak, and sprinted for the shrine.
  BREAK
  EXPO: Saoirse stood at the top of the sand dune and looked east, over the rooftops of the fishing village. The ocean was choppy, and summer's heat had given way to more moderate weather. But the wind was high, which was exactly what she wanted. Today was the day.
  EXPO: She'd discovered the craft while mapping the woods further inland. It had been badly damaged, abandoned long ago. Long ago enough that the forest had almost claimed it entirely, much like its former rider's bones. But it called to her, begged to be restored.
  EXPO: Several other residents of the fishing village had come to the dune to watch. There was a general sense of optimism - Saoirse's previous attempts had met with halting, cautious success. But today was the real test.
  EXPO: She pulled her goggles down and knocked back the kickstand with her heel. She placed a gloved palm on the machine's nameplate. The whirring magical engine at the heart of the machine whispered to her.
  ???|L: Are you ready to fly, rider?
  SAOIRSE|R: Are <i>you</i>, Branford?
  BRANFORD|L: I was <i>made</i> to fly.
  EXPO: The engine flared, and the arc-halo lifted the craft off the ground. This was going to make charting the island much easier.
  BREAK
  EXPO: Saoirse swatted a tree branch out of the way and gripped her reins tightly. She was on edge - the blood panther had been spotted in this forest only a few days ago. It had killed two cows and wounded a farmer in the nearby village. But she'd pursued it this far, and she wasn't about to let a tangle of scrub and fallen logs stop her now.
  EXPO: A hart, previously still with fear, darted away somewhere to her left. Her wyvern turned to follow it, and she gently tugged on the reins to bring its focus back to <i>her</i> hunt.
  SAOIRSE|L: I know you're hungry, Novi. Me too.
  EXPO: She'd taken the job reluctantly. She didn't need the money at the moment, and blood panthers tended to hide during the day. But the village didn't have anyone capable of taking down a beast like this on their own. And left to their own devices, blood panthers would mate with regular panthers, always passing down their voracious appetite and wild strength to their offspring through some cruel trick of heredity.
  EXPO: Novi stopped and sniffed at the ground. Saoirse grabbed one of her spear from the saddle harness. Her prey was near. She clenched her teeth and dropped down from Novi's back. The growl from the overhang was unmistakable, and she dug in her heels as the panther dropped towards her.
  BREAK
  EXPO: Saoirse rolled over in her bed, away from the morning sunlight. She had slept fitfully, and her dreams, though vivid in sleep, began to fade into the clarity of consciousness. She sat up after a moment, throwing off the heavy comforter.
  PROMPT: One of these is not a dream, but a memory. Who is Saoirse?
  VOTE-OPEN: A machine-flying cartographer|A dungeon-delving relic seeker|A wyvern-riding monster hunter`,
