  `SCENE: Southeast Granvista - Yuvalt Monastery
  MUSIC: Final Fantasy Tactics OST - Under the Stars|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcwkD_e4MVk
  EXPO: Guarding the monastery was tedious at the best of times. Today the skies were completely clouded over, and despite the lack of sunlight, the heat was oppressive. Saoirse looked down into the courtyard. One of the monks, a young woman, was moving through the steps of some form or another, probably something obtuse like "Seven Sisters Run Down the Mountain".
  EXPO: The floor hatch to the belltower lifted, and Parzeval, smartly dressed in his cadet's tunic, poked his head up from below.
  SAOIRSE|R: What's going on?
  PARZEVAL|L: Garven wants to see us in the barrack.
  SAOIRSE|R: Fine. Did he say what for?
  PARZEVAL|L: He did not.
  ACTION: Soairse jerked her thumb towards the courtyard.
  SAOIRSE|R: Does he want <i>her</i> involved?
  PARZEVAL|L: I think so.
  ACTION: Saoirse scowled.
  ???|R: Hey, where are you from?!
