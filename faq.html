      <h2>What is Chaos Quest?</h2>
<p>
Chaos Quest is a Choose Your Own Adventure style story. Each scene will tell a bit of the story and then be followed by a vote. While voting is open, you can influence how the story will change.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What kind of story is it?</h2>
<p>
In case the title didn't give it away, it's a fantasy RPG. At the start of the story, things will be necessarily vague - I'm not starting with a lot of worldbuilding. But depending on how the votes go, the world could be fleshed out any number of ways. Maybe there are castles, crystals and airships, maybe there are guns, railroads and airships, maybe there are time-travel and floating continents and airships... you get the idea. If you've played Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Tales, you know what to expect. It's all on the table.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Does that mean random encounters?</h2>
<p>
It does have battles, yes! What would a JRPG be without battles? Of course, as an audience-driven story, it's not combat you can actually <i>play</i>, but each combat will have a vote beforehand where you can choose to boost the priority of one of the party members' abilities. This matters because without votes, a unit will just use the basic attack command on every turn, reducing their earned XP. Each party member's ability pool will be based on all votes received, and the character who receives the most votes overall will have boosted stats. Once the votes are tallied, the next scene will be presented as a 2d sprite based battle that plays out based on a real combat engine.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>How exactly does combat work?</h2>
<p>
Under the hood, it's a charge-time based system like Final Fantasy Tactics. Units' CT increments based on their SPD, and when it reaches 100, they get a turn. An ability is chosen from that unit's ability pool, and that ability fires. The effectiveness is determined by the unit and target's stats (ATK, DEF, RES, SPD). Some units have reaction abilities, like counter attacks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What happens if the party is defeated?</h2>
<p>
There will be a vote to either re-attempt the combat following a new ability-boost vote, to lower the difficulty of the encounter, or to accept the consequences of failure and continue the story. The severity of the consequences depend on the margin of enemy victory. If the party gets absolutely stomped, a character could be grievously wounded or even killed, but if it was a near thing, it may just mean a permanent stat decrease, loss of an item, or simply a change to how the story progresses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Have you done something like this before?</h2>
<p>
The precursor to Chaos Quest was a CYOA run on the Penny Arcade forums called <a href="https://forums.penny-arcade.com/discussion/241072/cyoa-ardor-obligation-epilogue/p1">Ardor & Obligation</a>. It started off as a text-only adventure, but as it progressed I added more accoutrements familiar to the genre, like a status screen, simple combat, and minigames. Some of it worked, some of it didn't. It was a learning process! The story started in June 2021 and finished up in August. But that story won't have much influence over this one. It <i>is</i> possible that Chaos Quest may become something of an umbrella term over multiple stories, but for now it's just one.</p>

<h2>What's going on in the story right now?</h2>
<p>
New readers are free to vote on the current open vote, but should start the story at the beginning by clicking the First link. The site layout follows a typical webcomic navigation structure. You might also check out the Party Status page.</p>
